This is a simple tool to read data from a Killer Queen machine and plot the
locations of in-game kills onto a heatmap, to produce a visualizatio of
that aspect of game play.

# To Use

1. Connect your computer in a way that the Killer Queen machine is either
   on the same network, or accessible over the network in some other way.
2. Find the IP address or host name assigned to the KQ machine.
3. Test that value by typing it in to your web browser, you should
   see the Killer Queen Tournament set up screen.
4. Download [kqdeathmap](https://github.com/arantius/kqdeathmap/archive/master.zip)
   and extract it somewhere.
5. Open `map.html`.
6. Type in that same IP or host name.
7. Play!  Pick the day/night/dusk map by clicking the buttons or pressing
   the underlined keyboard hotkey, so the data is sorted correctly.
